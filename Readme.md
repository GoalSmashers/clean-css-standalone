## What is clean-css-standalone? ##

Clean-css-standalone is (obviously) a standalone version of clean-css node.js library.

That is all you need to do is to grab **clean-css.js** file and put it somewhere in your project. The only dependency is node.js itself.

## Usage ##

### How to use it? ###

    node path/to/clean-css.js -h

See the [clean-css repository](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css) for examples (remember to replace 'cleancss' with 'node clean-css.js').
